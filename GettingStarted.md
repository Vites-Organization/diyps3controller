# Introduction #

This wiki explains how to install Eclipse CDT with SVN and AVR plugins.
It explains how to perform a checkout and build the project.

Target OS is Windows, but it can be easily adapted to Linux.

# WinAVR #

Download and install WinAVR from http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/files/

# Eclipse CDT #

A java jre is required (http://javadl.sun.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=39494 or browse http://www.java.com/).

Extract it to a directory (for ex. C:\AVR\Eclipse).
